===================

The OWASP Top 10 is the de facto list of the top 10 most prevalent web application attacks. A challenge for many security practitioners is taking such a list of high-level attacks and turning those into real, actionable protection for our applications. In this session we will demonstrate how we can quickly protect against the OWASP Top 10 by leveraging solutions across the F5 technology portfolio including BIG-IP Advanced WAF, NGINX WAF and F5 Rules for AWS WAF.

This class covers the following topics:

- Introduction to the OWASP Top 10
- Create a new BIG-IP Advanced WAF Policy for an existing web application
- Leverage F5 WAF Tester to assess vulnerabilities in an existing web application
â€“ Explore the BIG-IP OWASP Top 10 Compliance Dashboard
- IP OWASP Top 10 Dashboard to mitigate OWASP Top 10 attacks
- Leverage F5 WAF Tester to assess vulnerabilities in an existing web application
